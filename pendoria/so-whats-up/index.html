        <h2 id="15-grand-for-charity">1.5 Grand For Charity!</h2>

<p>Breast Cancer Awareness month ended a decent bit ago,
and as I mentioned in my last post, 50% of all purchases were going to charity during that month.
The total amount to be donated totalled up to a whopping 1,550 USD!
All of which will be donated to the norwegian charity “brystkreftforeningen”.</p>

<p>“brystkreftforeningen”</p>

<p>Try saying that three times, or even just once… yeah…</p>

<p>Charity Link (Page is in norwegian);

<h2 id="angular-rewrite">Angular Rewrite</h2>

<p>Everybody knows that Pendoria’s client side code is filled with bugs and lag infested code left over from Pendoria’s initial launch just under 2 years ago.
As a result Xortorx has decided it is time to clean up said code and ensure it runs both smoother and faster.
As Xotrox mentioned in the latest news post that his current goal is to rewrite all of the current client side code inside <a href="https://angular.io">Angular 8+</a>.
While this doesn’t mean anything much to regular players, it will mean less bugs, less lag, and and an overall better experience.</p>

<p><strong>TLDR</strong>; Less bugs and better performance in the future!</p>

<p>​</p>

<h2 id="but-content">But… Content?</h2>

<p>As Xortox stated in the news post I mentioned earlier,
due to the development team focusing mostly on the rewrite I doubt anyone will be able to promise any new content any time soon.
Once we feel fairly comfortable with the rewrite he’ll most likely evaluate the possibility of working on some new content on the side.</p>

<p>The content that was already on the ToDo list is still there, it just got knocked behind the rewrite.
On the upside we should be seeing less development bumps in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Side Note</strong>: I’ve been promoted to developer - so I guess that means I’m a little biased now…</p>

<p>​</p>

<h2 id="maria-stepped-down">Maria Stepped Down</h2>

<p>The situation with Maria is no longer as foggy as it once was,
from the looks of it Maria now has no place in the staff team whatsoever.</p>

<p>While it’s been a rough past month I have to say I do wish her well in her next project - whatever it may be.</p>

<p>​</p>

<h2 id="rolls-are-not-content">Rolls Are Not Content</h2>

<p>Seeing as Aylea feels the need to “throw some shade” (she calls it this for some weird unknown reason) on me every time she posts on the r/PBBG subreddit,
I felt it would be fitting to address that right here on my post.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Rolls 👏 are 👏 not 👏 content.</strong></p>

  <p>Let me repeat myself.</p>

  <p><strong>Rolls 👏 are 👏 not 👏 content.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>My Response; I’m sorry you feel the need to complain about free bound rhodium being given away by staff,
I’ll be sure to let the proper staff members know that this is an issue that really needs to be addressed.</p>

<p><em>/s if it wasn’t obvious :)</em></p>

<p>Oh god - Aylea makes up 1/4th of my topics this post…. yikes.</p>

<p><strong>Side Note</strong>; We have 2 new moderators, so check out <code class="highlighter-rouge">/join games</code> and try and win some free rhodium!</p>

<h2 id="impulsive-updates">Impulsive Updates</h2>

<p>That actually goes for the content within my posts such as this,

<p>This blog gets my latest posts before I convert them to Reddit posts, all of which are about Pendoria.
I’ve been working with some players to attempt to maybe get some other writers to post updates on the other games such as Ava, IQ, or Lyr.</p>
