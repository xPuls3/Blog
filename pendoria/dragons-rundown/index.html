        <p>This is me, Puls3, exporting and reformatting Dragon’s rundown on recent changes to the numbers.
This was a lot of work exporting it from Discord and probably much more from Dragon, so yeah.</p>

<p>Due to most of this not being my original work I will not be including a referral link in this post.</p>

<p>I figured having all of this inside a huge quote block would just be annoying.</p>

<p><strong>Everything below here is modified quotes from dragon.</strong></p>

<hr />

<p>​</p>

<p>To be a bit more transparent around the recent changes here’s a wall of text about the recent ones.</p>

<h2 id="gathering-xp">Gathering XP</h2>

<p>This ends up being a UI change but sets the stage for base boosts soon™.</p>

<p>Prior, gathering XP per level and required XP per level were something like…</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">XP_Per_Level = 1.01^(Level)</code></p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">XP_Req_Per_Level = 1.02^(Level) </code></p>

<p>As you leveled up your TS skills you started gaining super high XP per action and needing even higher XP to level.
This created bigger numbers than the server was happy with so we simplified to something like…</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">XP_Per_Level = 1</code></p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">XP_Req_Per_Level = 1.02^(Level)/1.01^(Level)</code></p>

<p>Now, your XP is independent of level and the level XP scales upward per level.</p>

<p>This solves 2 issues:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Server is happy (Yay)</li>
  <li>It’s much easier to add base boosts like shown below.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here’s an example;
<code class="highlighter-rouge">TS Lvl XP: +1 XP per Base Boost Level </code></p>

<p>Since it’s consistent across every level.</p>

<p>Note that this is not me committing anything to roadmap, just making a point.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Gathering XP update makes server happy and creates a better system to add buffs to soon(tm)</p>

<p>​</p>

<h2 id="enemy-damage-increase">Enemy Damage Increase</h2>

<p>As some have may have figured out both player HP and enemy damage have an exponential component to them.
The driving reason for the change was that the player HP increased much faster than the Monster damage.</p>

<p>Something like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/dt3rVl9ORU_DI4wUjjI117Fn_vsre6mQL4dg-tEZ8S1VBUENFcA3wNszqPCViqrbGVjEjER-YYWeRmXCtcZyWIVAufKYvJuI4CW3MsvkOL1dUrE1AFDLa-b7cT8Pb3X_G-YHWIiw" alt="Math Stuffs" /></p>

<p>The outcome is that as players gain levels their progression rate accelerates.
For design purposes we consider this bad because the top players gain a
disproportionate share of the income (and thus resources) and snowball forward.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> This was a nerf to mitigate snowballing of the highest level players.
Everyone got hit, the higher level you were the more you got hit.</p>

<p>​</p>

<h2 id="critical-hit-damage">Critical Hit Damage</h2>

<p>This is another buff that was out of line with its compatriots.
If you think about how Critical % Chance (CHC) and Critical % Damage (CHD) relate it’s something like:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Total Damage = (Damage) * (1+CHC) * (1+CHD) = (Damage) * (1+0.01*CHC_Lvl) * (1+0.1*CHD_Lvl) </code></p>

<p>If you break that out it becomes quite apparent that CHD is significantly more valuable than anything else.
To illustrate that, consider going from level 1000 to 2000 with each.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Base: (1 + 0.001 * 1000) * (1 + 0.010 * 1000) = 22

CHC+: (1 + 0.001 * 2000) * (1 + 0.010 * 1000) = 33 (+50%)

CHD+: (1 + 0.010 * 2000) * (1 + 0.001 * 1000) = 42 (+90%)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is non-ideal since CHD and the other SP damage related boosts (CHC, Power, Dexterity)
share the same cost curve as CHD but are less efficient at progressing users.
This update takes CHD from OP OP to just OP. Players with a lot more CHD got impacted the most.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> CHD was super overpowered, now it’s just overpowered.
I haven’t done the math but my guess is that you should still have CHD as your highest SP boost as a combatant.</p>

<p>​</p>

<h2 id="base-damage">Base Damage</h2>

<p>This and base armor are complete buffs.
Nothing was removed regarding how they work but new components were added. Prior, base damage gave damage at a lower ratio versus the other (primary) damage components.
At low levels that was fine, but it didn’t interact with the part of the equation that was generating the majority of equations for combatants. To put it in rough terms:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Prior_Damage = Power * Weapon_Damage * Stuff + Base Damage`

New_Damage = Power * (Weapon_Damage + Base Damage) * Stuff + Base Damage
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There are a couple reasons we went this route:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Base damage no longer sucks. (yay!)</li>
  <li>Prior, if you had a non-ideal weapon you would struggle versus your peers, base damage evens the playing field.</li>
  <li>Base damage now scales nicely across all levels and has no real “soft cap”.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you double your base damage your damage will see a significant increase (exact % is somewhat dependent on how OP your weapon is or is not)</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Base damage no longer sucks and has ROI as a sink.</p>

<p>​</p>

<h2 id="base-armor">Base Armor</h2>

<p>Base armor was a solid option prior to the enemy damage increase which kind of ruined it.
This was an oops and an oversight on my end.
What we’ve done in the latest release is to add in a factor of % damage reduction granted by it.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Prior_Damage_Taken = (Damage) - (Base Armor)</code></p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">New_Damage_Taken = (Damage) / (Base Armor * Stuff) - Base Armor</code></p>

<p>Take the above equations really roughly but it now gives an additional small % damage reduction along with the flat reduction you saw prior.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/oqONdX_-21l84uCZdUjHbSs4EzYQ-FR2l5qHBmN1_GGHavnXsbgvfq3wtGB4336ew6L92lJZtm6fQDWt0VnkWmOGaPZUSI22uYomIh4SGZ34gk6D443VDpmGLVPRfFGPwF9JzQob" alt="Math Stuffs" /></p>

<p>Base armor might still be a bit underpowered, but now it’s not useless and in part scales consistently across all levels. This may be worth returning to at some point.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Base armor used to be good, was terrible after enemy damage got buffed, now is ok</p>

<p>​</p>

<h2 id="out-of-your-league">Out of your League</h2>

<p>This is a small change, but basically if you start to snowball super hard and fight level 10,000 enemies as a level 100 player they will be relatively harder than someone who is level 1,000.
Progression is tied in some ways to how much “stronger” the enemies are than you based on your level, this acts as a buffer (not blocker) as folks start to push forward.
I haven’t checked all players but as a general estimation &lt;10% of combatants were affected by this change and anyone under level 7,500 was unaffected (this only kicks in during/after the mid game).</p>
