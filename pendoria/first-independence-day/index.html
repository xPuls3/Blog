        <h2 id="another-news-post-already">Another News Post Already?</h2>

<p>You know when you want to wait to do something,
but it becomes even more of a bigger task the longer you wait?
Yeah, that’s this post. Maria has been doing a very good job spamming out helpful updates recently,
and I feared if I waited any longer that this list would get way too long.</p>

<p>​</p>

<h2 id="first-celebrated-independence-day">First Celebrated Independence Day?</h2>

<p>Despite my cries last year, Pendoria has never before celebrated The United States’ Independence Day,
recently this has changed as Pendoria celebrates its first every 4th of July event,
equipped with titles such as Free and Independent able to be purchased.
It’s a standard re-skin of the usual events with points as well as loot crates renamed to something more special sounding.</p>

<p>As this is an event a promotion is now active,
all purchases receive 100% more rhodium as well as 1 promotion point per single United States dollar.</p>

<p><strong>The event will continue until July 12th!</strong></p>

<p>​</p>

<h2 id="should-i-blame-maria-as-usual">Should I Blame Maria? (as usual)</h2>

<p>During the recent Independence Day event Maria apparently had an accidental “typo” in her code,
it resulted in the coveted limited event titles to be incapable of being purchased until almost July 7th.
Chat was unsurprisingly plagued with complaints.</p>

<p>​</p>

<h2 id="blasphemy">Blasphemy!?</h2>

<p>Due to recent droughts in ingots caused by Lady Luck being less than fair to us Pendorians,
ingots will now have a fixed drop rate! To put this in simple words,
as opposed to an ingot having a one divided by x chance to drop each action,
a single ingot will be provided to you every x actions.</p>

<p>All drop rate modifiers will still effect the x variable in the same manner and amount as before.
This removes a major dependence on luck from the game,
and everyone seems to be very delighted about it indeed.</p>

<p>​</p>

<h2 id="no-more-market-spam">No More Market Spam?</h2>

<p>What Maria referred to as an unintended result of the implementation of buy orders caused quite a stir whenever multiple users flooded the buy order market with pages of multiple buy orders per user,
any Pendoria player knows that on the regular sell order market only 1 order can be put at a time,
the development team has taken a stance on this and completely removed the ability to post multiple buy orders as of July 6th,
no more market spam?
Yes indeed.</p>

<p>​</p>

<h2 id="are-annoying-sp-drops-fixed">Are Annoying SP Drops Fixed?</h2>

<p>This isn’t necessarily what happened, but it’s the end result that was intended.
So from the first implementation of recent statistics Battlers had gotten both small and large SP drops to show in their log,
recently Maria has made these small SP drops which were previously not shown to TSers,
spam the recent statistics in all of their glory.
TSers obviously didn’t like that, so now we have a filter for recent statistics,
isn’t that nice? Thanks Maria!</p>

<p>​</p>

<h2 id="anything-else">Anything Else?</h2>

<p>That’s not all the changes pushed this July 4th, some of the following are a few of the less interesting changes.</p>
<ul>
  <li>An Encampment tax option has been added so that you don’t run dry of materials.</li>
  <li>An Event calendar is now available while and event is running.</li>
  <li>Tool-tips on what boosts effect Encampment strength.</li>
  <li>Tool-tips on reminder pop-ups in case you forget what each little thing means.</li>
</ul>

<p>And there you have it, interesting or not, that’s what was modified recently.</p>

<p>​</p>
