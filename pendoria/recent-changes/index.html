        <h2 id="what">What?</h2>

<p>Recently quite a few changes have been made to Pendoria,
I have decided to write up a post detailing the recent changes of Pendoria from a positive point of view.
The idea for this came from Aylea but as we all know, she can’t write with a positive attitude.
So without further delay lets get to it.</p>

<p>​</p>

<h2 id="scraptown-catch-up-mechanic">Scraptown Catch-up mechanic</h2>

<p>Anyone behind on their Scraptown just got a major buff,
anyone 10 levels behind the current player with the #1 Rank in that building,
get a 2% speed increase for every level they are behind.
This changes some player’s days of waiting to a mere 2 hours,
new players Scraptown’s will certainly have a bright future.</p>

<p>​</p>

<h2 id="armory-boosting-gear-value">Armory Boosting Gear Value</h2>

<p>Armory levels now effect the scrapping value of gear,
on each piece of gear a 1% Spare Part value increase will be applied for every armory level on that specific piece of gear.
For those ahead in their Scraptown’s Armory level,
this is a major buff to income.</p>

<p>​</p>

<h2 id="another-satchel-balance">Another Satchel Balance</h2>

<p>The Satchel inside the Dungeon Tools (the resource % increase boost) just got a major re-balance,
it now costs the same as the Battle counterpart (which makes it cheaper) but now the increase for each level is now 5% instead of 5.5%,
this has been done to prevent the need for future changes to this boost, therefore we can all agree that this is a good change.</p>

<p>​</p>

<h2 id="rhodium-boosts-uncapped">Rhodium Boosts Uncapped</h2>

<p>Rhodium Boosts, which were capped to prevent ulta-high boosts are now uncapped!
You can purchase a cap increase (Global Exp Boost by 5%, Global Drop Boost by 1%, and SP Boost by 1%) for 16.20b gold and 540m of any resource,
this cost goes up each purchase and you do still need to pay the rhodium to increase the boost itself as this just increases the cap, according to Maria this is soft capped by the cost and so we will not see extremely high boosts.
We do not yet know if this is a change for the better as it is yet to be seen.</p>

<p>​</p>

<h2 id="daily-bound-sp">Daily Bound SP</h2>

<p>You can purchase up to 75k Bound Spare Parts from the NPC Store that costs 1K Gold per 1K SP, the cost goes up 1K for every 1K SP purchased.
This has increased the amount of SP in the game by a very large amount.</p>

<p>​</p>

<h2 id="ingots-for-rhodium">Ingots For Rhodium</h2>

<p>You can now purchase bound rhodium using Rhodium Ingots within the NPC Store, this is good for anyone with 100% dungeon uptime that have excess or for anyone with terrible dungeon tools.
Karubo the math wizard has been generous enough to add a comparison (TSers Only!) on his ROI sheet so that TSers can calculate this and know whether or not it’s truly worth it for them.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Karubo’s ROI Sheet: <a href="https://tiny.cc/KaruboROI">https://tiny.cc/KaruboROI</a></li>
</ul>

<p>​</p>

<h2 id="refresh-popup">Refresh Popup</h2>

<p>Another QoL feature, no longer will people toss and toil over fixed bugs, a popup will show every time the server reboots,
they have a commented out TODO in the code stating that this should only be done when the client’s code changes,
but that has not yet been done. Some players have chosen to complain, others are thankful, I do think this is a good addition however I will say that the popup is quite annoying.</p>

<p>​</p>

<h2 id="see-those-whom-fail-to-appreciate-your-messages">See Those Whom Fail To Appreciate Your Messages</h2>

<p>A small QoL feature, but a fun one; You can now see anyone whom has ‘/ignore’ -ed you simply by typing ‘/ignoredby’, my list was shorter than I was expecting, but no matter.</p>

<p>​</p>

<h2 id="goodbye-gale">Goodbye Gale</h2>

<p>And the last thing on my list, a change of staff positions. The long time Admin Gale “no longer has the time to” continue his duties on Pendora and “has asked to step down as admin”.
This was a shocking event despite that I have seen Gale become less active as of late. Evelyn, a player whom I know next to nothing about has been promoted directly from normal player to an admin,
I have personally had an awkward conversation with Gale to serve as a ‘I appreciate you’ sort of thing. I wonder what ‘Admin Evelyn’ will do in the future, we’ll all have to wait and see.</p>

<p>​</p>
