        <p>Considering there have been people wondering about Pendoria’s latest updates, I figured I would write up a quick summary about what’s going on in the world of Pendoria.</p>

<p>​</p>

<h2 id="unlimited-modifiers">Unlimited Modifiers!</h2>

<p>Previously we had double and triple, now after 26h of triple it becomes quadruple, after 28h of quadruple it becomes quintuple, etc.
This can continue for as long as the Pendoria community can push it - we now have higher modifiers than all the other games, because ours are unlimited! This does not effect the stat boost or double drop global modifiers.</p>

<p>Edit: Turns out it maxes at 20, but I think that might only be due to the fact that Maria doubts we’ll ever get there, though I could be wrong about that.</p>

<p>Another Edit: I received a message from Maria later after posting this, I wanted to include it as well.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>It’s client side, it stops at 20 as I have simply input the name of the multipliers all the way up to x20.
The server could handle it endlessly if the client had the names for it.
Theoretically you could fix that yourself if you really wanted too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>- Maria <em>(slightly modified)</em></p>

<p>It turns out it truly is endless!</p>

<p>​</p>

<h2 id="modifiers-effect-global-drops">Modifiers Effect Global Drops!</h2>

<p>As of this patch, modifiers (eg. double &amp; triple) will now effect the amount found from global drops!
For example if you were to find 1 rhodium during double, you would receive 2 rhodium.
This can work alongside the double drop modifier as that only doubles the chances of finding global drops.</p>

<p>Edit: I just got a confirmation from Maria that the global modifiers (eg. double and triple) only effect found Rhodium and Spare Parts, nothing else.</p>

<p>​</p>

<h2 id="shorter-invasions">Shorter Invasions!</h2>

<p>Damage done per wave has been multiplied by a whopping 400! Don’t worry though, now the damage is split between all alive players, this should help prevent a select few from dragging invasions on for hours without lowering the hard cap.</p>

<p>​</p>

<h2 id="public-task-boost">Public Task Boost!</h2>

<p>Some people won’t care about this, others will freak out. Previously all guild boosts were publically available both on rankings and on the guild page pardon one; Task Boost. As of this patch it’s getting both a ranking and added to the guild page. It is my estimation that this will make the premier guilds even more competitive.</p>

<p>​</p>

<h2 id="pendoria-donating-to-charity">Pendoria Donating To Charity!</h2>

<p>This was in my last post, but it was edited in so I wanted to include it again.</p>

<p>Xortrox explained this one really well, so I’ll quote him, but I figured it deserved a mention.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In the light of breast cancer awareness month we will be donating 50% of all income from rhodium purchases to a breast cancer charity. (link below)</p>

  <p>The charity chosen fights for supporting young victims of breast cancer by supplying welfare measures like rehabilitation,
or providing economical support to victims problems with the cost for treatment or medicine. For those interested in everything they do and offer, you can check out this link:</p>

  <p>(Page is in Norwegian) <a href="https://brystkreftforeningen.no/fa-hjelp/sok-stotte">https://brystkreftforeningen.no/fa-hjelp/sok-stotte</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>- Xortrox <em>(slightly modified)</em></p>

<p>Essentially, half of all donations for the entire month of October will be going to the charity, in addition to this an event will be running from October 4th to October 11th.</p>

<p>Xortrox has stated that he hopes this will have a positive impact for Pendoria’s community,
and that he can continue to do this in the future.</p>
