        <p>I’ve seen a lot of confusion around Pendoria and its latest updates recently, I figured it was time to release an unofficial news post to hopefully lessen both the tension and the confusion.</p>

<h2 id="pendoria-donating-to-charity">Pendoria Donating To Charity!</h2>

<p>Xortrox explained this one really well, so I’ll quote him, but I figured it deserved a mention.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In the light of breast cancer awareness month we will be donating 50% of all income from rhodium purchases to a breast cancer charity. (link below)</p>

  <p>The charity chosen fights for supporting young victims of breast cancer by supplying welfare measures like rehabilitation,
or providing economical support to victims problems with the cost for treatment or medicine. For those interested in everything they do and offer, you can check out this link:</p>

  <p>(Page is in Norwegian) <a href="https://brystkreftforeningen.no/fa-hjelp/sok-stotte">https://brystkreftforeningen.no/fa-hjelp/sok-stotte</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>- Xortrox <em>(slightly modified)</em></p>

<p>Essentially, half of all donations for the entire month of October will be going to the charity, in addition to this an event will be running from October 4th to October 11th.</p>

<p>Xortrox has stated that he hopes this will have a positive impact for Pendoria’s community,
and that he can continue to do this in the future.</p>

<p>​</p>

<h2 id="gear-upgrades-are-getting-replaced">Gear Upgrades Are Getting Replaced</h2>

<p>Gear itself will remain the same, however the upgrade feature which added that little +# (eg. +20) to the end is getting replaced with a similar feature.
This replacement upgrade is a personal upgrade tied to accounts as opposed to tied to the gear,
as now you are upgrading your equipment slots as opposed to the equipment itself.</p>

<p>For a period of one month whatever has been upgraded higher will be the one in effect,
the old feature or the new one, after that only the new one will work.</p>

<p>Side Note!</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gear upgrades, both before and after have never effected encampment and still don’t.</li>
  <li>Karubo’s ROI sheet has been updated for slots; <a href="http://pendcalc.karubo.de">http://pendcalc.karubo.de</a></li>
</ul>

<p>​</p>

<h2 id="golden-cogs">Golden Cogs</h2>

<p>Golden Cogs are a new item being added to the game that possess an extremely confusing drop rate (not effected by any drop boosts and starting at 1 every 5,000 actions).
These golden cogs can be exchanged to the server for 5k Spare Parts, therefore setting a base value, as they will be able to be traded via market.</p>

<p>Golden Cogs will be required by the new gear slot upgrades feature to upgrade your weapon slot over level 300, which is equivalent to the current gear upgrade level +30.</p>

<p>1 Cog is required per level from 300+, eg. level 301 costs 1, level 302 costs 2, etc.</p>

<p>As Maria seemed to leave out, they will be required for all slots, even for TSers.</p>

<p>​</p>

<h2 id="new-outskirt-buildings">New Outskirt Buildings</h2>

<p>4 new buildings are being added to the guild outskirts, each one of these will add a 1% modifier to all of the guild member’s corresponding encampment stat.
There’s not much to say about this so I won’t.</p>

<p>​</p>

<h2 id="battle-nerfs--ts-xp-changes">Battle Nerfs &amp; TS XP Changes</h2>

<p>I talked about this in my last post, it contains a ton of reasoning, graphs, numbers, and cold hard math.
